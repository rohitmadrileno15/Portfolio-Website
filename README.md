# Portfolio-Website

Minimalistic portfolio website.

Note:- I have used a CSS framework in it, which makes it so easier to define the layout.

Also, added some dumb functionality in it, which will prompt the user if in a non-pc device with an alert
And, a icon which will be seen only when internet connection is there.
